This tutorial will walk you through creating a song similar to the "Beatnic" example from scratch.

### Part 1: Loading and Playing the Example Song

First, let's see how to load and play a pre-made song. This is a good way to understand the app's capabilities.

1.  Scroll down to the **Example Songs** section and find the one named "Beatnic by mBitsnBites (simplified)".
2.  Copy the entire block of JSON text, starting with `[` and ending with `]`.
3.  In the app, find the large **textarea** on the right side. Delete any text that's already there.
4.  Paste the Beatnic song JSON into the textarea.
5.  A confirmation box will ask if you want to "Delete song patterns and keep only the instruments?". For this example, click **Cancel** to load the entire song, including its notes and patterns.
6.  You will see the **sequencer** grid fill up with numbers. These are the pattern IDs that make up the song.

**How to Play the Song:**

-   **Play the whole song:** Click the empty cell in the top-left corner of the **sequencer**. This selects all tracks and all phrases, and the song will begin to play from start to finish, looping when it's done. Click it again to stop playback.
-   **Play a limited part:** Let's say you only want to hear the first two tracks (the kick drum and hi-hat) for the first two phrases.
    1.  First, make sure nothing is playing (click the top-left cell if needed).
    2.  Click on the column header labeled **A**. It will become highlighted.
    3.  Click on the column header labeled **B**. It will also become highlighted.
    4.  Click on the row header labeled **1**. It will become highlighted.
    5.  Click on the row header labeled **2**. It will also become highlighted.
    6.  Playback will start automatically, looping only over tracks A and B for phrases 1 and 2. This is extremely useful for focusing on specific parts of your song.

### Part 2: Making Your Own Song

Now, let's create that song from a blank slate.

**Important:** There is no "Clear" or "New" button. To start a new song from scratch, you must **refresh your web browser** (F5 or Ctrl+R/Cmd+R). This will load the default empty project.

#### Step 1: Create a Kick Drum (Track A)

1.  **Select Track A:** In the **sequencer**, click the header for column **A**. This activates Track A for editing and previews its sound. The default sound is a simple sine wave.
2.  **Shape the Sound:** Now look at the **synth** sliders on the far left. We will adjust these to make a punchy kick drum sound.
    -   In the **Osc1** group, make sure the waveform `1w` is set to `0` (Sine).
    -   In the **EnvP** group, slide `e1` all the way to `1`. This routes the envelope to the oscillator's pitch, creating the classic "doop" sound of a kick drum by making the pitch drop quickly.
    -   In the **Env** group, lower the `ea` (attack), `es` (sustain), and `er` (release) sliders. A very low attack and sustain with a short release makes the sound percussive.
    -   In the **Filter** group, set `ct` (type) to `2` (Low-Pass). Lower the `ca` (amount) slider to cut the high frequencies, making the sound deeper and more bassy.
3.  **Check Your Work:** Click the **A** header again to hear your new kick drum sound. You can also look at the **textarea**; the first set of numbers inside the song data reflects the slider values you've been changing. You can even edit them directly in the textarea if you prefer.

#### Step 2: Create the Kick Drum Pattern

1.  **Select a Pattern:** With column **A** still selected, click the row header **1**. Now both are selected, and playback will start looping over this empty one-phrase section.
2.  In the **sequencer**, click the cell where column A and row 1 intersect. A `1` will appear. You have just assigned Pattern #1 to this part of the song.
3.  **Add Notes:** Look at the **piano** editor. It's a grid where columns are notes and rows are beats. Click on the piano grid to add your kick drum. For a standard four-on-the-floor beat, click the first cell (C3 note) on rows 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. As you click, you'll hear the notes being added to the looping pattern.

#### Step 3: Create a Hi-Hat (Track B)

1.  **Deselect everything:** Click the **A** and **1** headers to deselect them and stop playback.
2.  **Select Track B:** Click the header for column **B**.
3.  **Shape the Sound:**
    -   For a hi-hat, we want a noisy, sharp sound. Go to the **Noise** slider group and turn up the `nv` (noise volume) slider.
    -   In the **Env** group, set the `ea`, `es`, and `er` sliders to very low values for a short, sharp "tick" sound.
    -   To make it sound metallic, go to the **Filter** group and set `ct` to `1` (High-Pass). This removes the low-end rumble, leaving only the high-frequency hiss.
4.  **Create the Pattern:**
    -   Select row header **1**.
    -   Click the cell at the B/1 intersection to assign it Pattern #1 (note: this is Track B's Pattern #1, it's separate from Track A's).
    -   On the **piano** grid, add notes for the hi-hat. A simple pattern is to add notes on the off-beats: rows 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30.

#### Step 4: Combine and Build

1.  **Play them together:** Now, select the headers for column **A**, column **B**, and row **1**. You will hear your kick drum and hi-hat playing together in a looping pattern.
2.  **Add a Bassline (Track C):** Repeat the process. Select track **C**, shape a bass sound (try a Sawtooth waveform, `1w` set to `2`, with a Low-Pass filter), assign a pattern to cell C/1, and draw a simple melody on the piano grid.
3.  **Structure Your Song:**
    -   To make the next part of the song, use row **2**.
    -   You can **reuse patterns**. For example, click the cell at A/2 until it says `1`. Now phrase 2 will use the same kick drum pattern as phrase 1. Do the same for the hi-hat at B/2.
    -   You can **create a new pattern**. For the bassline, click the cell at C/2 until it says `2`. The piano grid will now be empty. You can create a new bassline here for the second phrase of your song.

By repeating this process—selecting a track, designing its sound, assigning patterns, and entering notes—you can build a full composition. Use the sequencer's row and column selection to listen to different parts of your song as you build it.
