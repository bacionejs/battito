Battito is a simple Sonant-based music tracker.

## Purpose
- The trackers I found were either too simple or too complex. This app tries to find a middle ground.

## Guide

- There are eight default instruments, or import from any Sonant-formatted data.
- To enter a note on the piano, first click ONLY one track and ONLY one row in the sequencer and click on the intersecting cell to select a pattern ID. Then you can edit that pattern on the piano. You can reuse a pattern ID.
- The song constantly loops over the selected sequencer rows and columns. To toggle the whole song, click the upper left of the sequencer.
- Supports 9 patterns per track, 8 tracks, and 8 phrases. Each phrase is the length of a pattern, which is 32, so the maximum length of a song is 8 Ã— 32.
- Edit the first value in the textarea to change tempo.
- Pasting into the textarea gives the option to import a whole song or instruments only.
- For an example of music in a game, see [Bike](https://github.com/bacionejs/bike).
