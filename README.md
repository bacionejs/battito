Battito is a simple Sonant-based music tracker.

## Purpose
- Why another tracker, when there are several already out there (note1 zzfxm, sonant, soundbox, pl_synth, other that they reference)
- The trackers I found were either too simple or too complex. This app tries to find a middle ground.

## Guide

- There are eight default instruments, or you can import any Sonant JSON.
- To enter a note on the piano, first click ONLY one row and ONLY one column in the **sequencer** and click on the intersecting cell to select a pattern ID. Then you can edit that pattern on the **piano**. You can reuse a pattern ID.
- The song constantly loops over the **selected** sequencer rows and columns. To toggle the whole song, click the upper left of the sequencer.
- You can select multiple sequencer rows and columns for **playback**, but you can only have one row and one column selected while **editing** notes on the piano.
- Supports 4 octaves from C3 through C6, 9 patterns per track, 8 tracks, and 8 phrases. Each phrase is the length of a pattern, which is 32, so the maximum length of a song is 8 Ã— 32.
- Edit the first value in the textarea to change tempo.
- When pasting JSON into the textarea, you will be asked if you want to import the whole **song** or only the **instruments**.
- Click on the column headers in the sequencer to hear what the instruments sound like.
- Supports nine patterns per track. To advance the Pattern ID number just keep clicking in the Sequencer cell.
- You can also edit the JSON song data directly in the textarea.
- For an example of music in a game, see [Bike](https://github.com/bacionejs/bike).

## Example Songs

## Notes

- For the pattern editor, Battito uses a 2D grid (4 octaves), whereas other apps use a 1D grid (value column). The Battito solution is **less flexible**, but requires **less clicks** and allows **simultaneous spacial visualization of note relationships and of multiple tracks (color coded)**. 
- No instrument designer, but you can import existing songs which have instruments that you like and when prompted after pasting into the textarea, answer yes to import only instruments.
- Only 8 tracks (instruments), 8 phrases, 9 patterns per track, 32 step patterns, 4 octaves (c3-c6)
